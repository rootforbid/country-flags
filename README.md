# Accurate country flags

This repository contains accurate renders of all the worlds flags in SVG format.

We make every effort to maintain the most accurate repository of flags. That is, flags that most closely match what the country or territory's laws and regulations describe the flags as being.

The source files were taken from Wikimedia Commons and sometimes contributed back
(when the country legislation more accurately describes what the flag should
look like). The flags are not under copyright protection since flags are in public
domain (there may be other restrictions on how the flag can be used though).


## Flags are organized by "ISO country-code"

The flags are named by their 2-letter ISO-3166 country code, except for the
constituent countries of Great Britain which have 6-letter codes "GB-ENG" etc).

Kosovo uses the user-assigned country code `XK`, which is not part of the ISO standard, but in use by several multinational organizations.

Also included is a JSON file that maps the ISO country code to the name of the
country.
